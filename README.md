## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the Beauty Saloon project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- **Java Development Kit (JDK):** Ensure that you have JDK 17 or a compatible version installed on your system. You can download it from the official Oracle website or use a distribution like OpenJDK.

- **PostgreSQL Database:** You need a PostgreSQL database to run this project. If you don't have PostgreSQL installed, download and install it from the official website: [PostgreSQL Downloads](https://www.postgresql.org/download/).

### Clone the Repository

First, clone the Beauty Saloon repository to your local machine:

```bash
https://github.com/OleksiiDmitriiev/beauty-saloon.git
```

### Database Setup

1. **Create a PostgreSQL Database:**

   Create a new PostgreSQL database for Beauty Saloon. You can do this using the `createdb` command or a PostgreSQL client like pgAdmin.

2. **Restore the Database:**

   Once the database is created, you'll need to restore the database schema and data from an SQL dump file. We've provided a sample SQL dump file (`beauty_saloon_db.sql`) in the project repository.

   Use the following command to restore the database from the SQL dump file:

   ```bash
   psql -U postgres -d beauty_saloon_db -a -f beauty_saloon_db.sql
   ```
